Great! You're referring to **Property I.2** from *Algorithms in C* by **Robert Sedgewick**, which appears in the section discussing **dynamic connectivity**, specifically the **quick-union** algorithm.

Let’s break it down:

------

### 📘 Property I.2:

> **"For M > N, the quick-union algorithm could take more than MN/2 instructions to solve a connectivity problem with M pairs of N objects."**

------

### 🔍 What does this mean?

This property points out a **worst-case performance scenario** for the **quick-union** algorithm.

#### 🧠 Background:

- In the **dynamic connectivity** problem, you're given a set of **N objects**.
- You get **M pairs** (connections) and need to determine if the two items in each pair are connected.
- If not, you connect them (union operation).

#### 🧩 Quick-Union:

- Each object points to a *parent*, forming a forest (a set of trees).
- To find the root of an object, you follow its parent pointers.
- To **connect** two objects, you link the root of one to the root of the other.

------

### ⚠️ Why could it take > MN/2 instructions?

In the **worst-case scenario**, the quick-union algorithm can be very **inefficient**. Here's how:

- The trees can get **very tall** if you always link one root to another without balancing.
- To **find the root**, you might need to follow a long chain of parent pointers — possibly up to **N steps** for a single `find`.
- If this happens frequently — say, in **M operations**, and each takes up to **N/2** steps on average — the total number of instructions can exceed **MN/2**.

------

### 📊 Example:

Imagine this extreme situation:

- Start with N nodes, each in its own set.
- Perform M union operations in such a way that the trees become **long chains**.
- Each new union adds one more level of depth.
- Eventually, finding roots becomes expensive (linear in N).

Then over M operations, the total cost could approach or exceed **MN/2**.

------

### 💡 Takeaway:

This property highlights a major weakness in the basic **quick-union** approach — **it’s not efficient for large-scale problems** without optimization.

👉 That’s why later improvements like:

- **Weighted Quick-Union**
- **Path Compression**

… were introduced — to keep trees **shallow** and make `find` and `union` operations much faster.
